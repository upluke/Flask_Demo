    <!--1. The form sumbit our data, just one field, to /greet as a get request, so username will be stored as part 
    of the query string -->
    <!-- 2. then route/greet(in app.py) is going to have access to username through request.args, which is compiled or constructed 
    based off of the incoming query string. So we grab that username and pass it into the template,3. we also pick a random compliment from a list,
     we pass that in, we render greet.html with those two variables.  -->
    <!-- 3. In greet.html, we have access to those two variables, and we just add them into our markup. -->
